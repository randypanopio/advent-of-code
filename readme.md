# Advent Of Code :christmas_tree:
Collection of my attempts at AoC challenges with languages I am currently learning and practicing!

Check out the Advent of Code [initiative](https://adventofcode.com/)

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
